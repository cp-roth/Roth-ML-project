  abstract = {Modern science and ideas of race have long been entangled, sharing notions of order, classification, and hierarchy. Ordering the Human presents cutting-edge interdisciplinary scholarship that examines the racialization of science in various global contexts, illuminating how racial logics have been deployed to classify, marginalize, and oppress.These wide-ranging essays---written by experts in genetics, forensics, public health, history, sociology, and anthropology---investigate the influence of racial concepts in scientific knowledge production across regions and eras. Chapters excavate the mechanisms by which racialized science serves projects of power and domination, and they explore different forms of resistance. Topics range from skull collecting by eighteenth-century German and Dutch scientists to the use of biology to reinforce notions of purity in present-day South Korea and Brazil. The authors investigate the colonial legacies of the pathologization of weight for the Maori people, the scientific presumption of coronary artery disease risk among South Asians, and the role of racial categories in COVID-19 statistics and responses, among many other cases. Tracing the pernicious consequences of the racialization of science, Ordering the Human shines a light on how the naturalization of racial categories continues to shape health and inequality today.},

  abstract = {Background:~           Foreign-born women have heavier infants than US-born women, but it is unclear whether this advantage persists across generations for all races and ethnicities.           Methods:~           Using 1971--2015 Florida birth records, we linked records of female infants within families to assess intergenerational changes in birthweight and prevalence of low birthweight by grandmother's race/ethnicity and foreign-born status. We also assessed educational gradients in low birthweight in two generations.           Results:~           Compared with daughters of US-born black women, daughters of foreign-born black women had substantially higher birthweights (3,199 vs. 3,083\,g) and lower prevalence of low birthweight (7.8\% vs. 11.8\%). Daughters of foreign-born Hispanic women had moderately higher birthweights (3,322 vs. 3,268 grams) and lower prevalence of low birthweight (4.5\% vs. 6.2\%) than daughters of US-born Hispanic women. In the next generation, a Hispanic foreign-origin advantage persisted in low birthweight prevalence (6.1\% vs. 7.2\%), but the corresponding black foreign-origin advantage was almost eliminated (12.2\% vs. 13.1\%). Findings were robust to adjustment for sociodemographic and medical risk factors. In contrast to patterns for other women, the prevalence of low birthweight varied little by maternal education for foreign-born black women. However, a gradient emerged among their US-born daughters.           Conclusions:~           The convergence of birthweight between descendants of foreign-born and US-born black women is consistent with theories positing that lifetime exposure to discrimination and socioeconomic inequality is associated with adverse health outcomes for black women. The emergence of a distinct educational gradient in low birthweight prevalence between generations underscores hypothesized adverse effects of multiple dimensions of disadvantage.},

These associations have been extensively replicated in studies in different countries and are not the result of confounding variables. They extend across the normal range of birthweight and depend on lower birthweights in relation to the duration of gestation rather than the effects of premature birth. The associations are thought to be consequences of developmental plasticity, the phenomenon by which one genotype can give rise to a range of different physiological or morphological states in response to different environmental conditions during development. Recent observations have shown that impaired growth in infancy and rapid childhood weight gain exacerbate the effects of impaired prenatal growth. A new vision of optimal early human development is emerging which takes account of both short and long-term outcomes.},

  abstract = {Babies born clinically Small- or Large-for-Gestational-Age (SGA or LGA; sex- and gestational age-adjusted birth weight (BW) {$<$}10th or {$>$}90th percentile, respectively), are at higher risks of complications. SGA and LGA include babies who have experienced environment-related growth-restriction or overgrowth, respectively, and babies who are heritably small or large. However, the relative proportions within each group are unclear. We assessed the extent to which common genetic variants underlying variation in birth weight influence the probability of being SGA or LGA. We calculated independent fetal and maternal genetic scores (GS) for BW in 11,951 babies and 5,182 mothers. These scores capture the direct fetal and indirect maternal (via intrauterine environment) genetic contributions to BW, respectively. We also calculated maternal fasting glucose (FG) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) GS. We tested associations between each GS and probability of SGA or LGA. For the BW GS, we used simulations to assess evidence of deviation from an expected polygenic model. Higher BW GS were strongly associated with lower odds of SGA and higher odds of LGA (ORfetal = 0.75 (0.71,0.80) and 1.32 (1.26,1.39); ORmaternal = 0.81 (0.75,0.88) and 1.17 (1.09,1.25), respectively per 1 decile higher GS). We found evidence that the smallest 3\% of babies had a higher BW GS, on average, than expected from their observed birth weight (assuming an additive polygenic model: Pfetal = 0.014, Pmaternal = 0.062). Higher maternal SBP GS was associated with higher odds of SGA P = 0.005. We conclude that common genetic variants contribute to risk of SGA and LGA, but that additional factors become more important for risk of SGA in the smallest 3\% of babies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Newborn weight may vary between ethnic groups, but it is not known if birthweight differences exist between term babies born to immigrant mothers compared with those born in their corresponding native countries. METHODS: We completed a systematic review of all birthweight curves published between 1980 and 2012, based on at least 100 singleton deliveries. We compared the 10th, 50th and 90th percentile birthweight values at 40 weeks gestation for male and female infants born in their native country vs. those infants born to mothers who had emigrated from their native country to Ontario, Canada. For the 50th percentile values, we also calculated a standardised pooled weighted difference and 95\% confidence interval [CI] for both sexes. We also assessed whether birthweight differed over time, or if the differences varied by the Human Development Index (HDI) value for the native country. RESULTS: A total of 31 studies from 21 different countries met the inclusion criteria, comprising 13\,317\,578 males and 12\,859\,119 females born at 40 weeks gestation. There was a small non-significant rise in reported birthweight percentile values between 1983 and 2006. Nearly all infants born to women in their native country had lower birthweights than those born to mothers who had emigrated from the same country to Canada at the 10th, 50th and 90th percentiles. Overall, the 50th percentile weights differed by 115 g [95\% CI 74, 156] for males and 122 g [95\% CI 95, 150] for females. As HDI or median birthweight increased, birthweight differences were less pronounced, but not significantly so. CONCLUSIONS: Term birthweight percentiles are typically higher among term infants born to mother who immigrate to Canada than those of infants born in their respective native country.},

  abstract = {In 2017-2019, the March of Dimes convened a workgroup with biomedical, clinical, and epidemiologic expertise to review knowledge of the causes of the persistent Black-White disparity in preterm birth (PTB). Multiple databases were searched to identify hypothesized causes examined in peer-reviewed literature, 33 hypothesized causes were reviewed for whether they plausibly affect PTB and either occur more/less frequently and/or have a larger/smaller effect size among Black women vs. White women. While definitive proof is lacking for most potential causes, most are biologically plausible. No single downstream or midstream factor explains the disparity or its social patterning, however, many likely play limited roles, e.g., while genetic factors likely contribute to PTB, they explain at most a small fraction of the disparity. Research links most hypothesized midstream causes, including socioeconomic factors and stress, with the disparity through their influence on the hypothesized downstream factors. Socioeconomic factors alone cannot explain the disparity's social patterning. Chronic stress could affect PTB through neuroendocrine and immune mechanisms leading to inflammation and immune dysfunction, stress could alter a woman's microbiota, immune response to infection, chronic disease risks, and behaviors, and trigger epigenetic changes influencing PTB risk. As an upstream factor, racism in multiple forms has repeatedly been linked with the plausible midstream/downstream factors, including socioeconomic disadvantage, stress, and toxic exposures. Racism is the only factor identified that directly or indirectly could explain the racial disparities in the plausible midstream/downstream causes and the observed social patterning. Historical and contemporary systemic racism can explain the racial disparities in socioeconomic opportunities that differentially expose African Americans to lifelong financial stress and associated health-harming conditions. Segregation places Black women in stressful surroundings and exposes them to environmental hazards. Race-based discriminatory treatment is a pervasive stressor for Black women of all socioeconomic levels, considering both incidents and the constant vigilance needed to prepare oneself for potential incidents. Racism is a highly plausible, major upstream contributor to the Black-White disparity in PTB through multiple pathways and biological mechanisms. While much is unknown, existing knowledge and core values (equity, justice) support addressing racism in efforts to eliminate the racial disparity in PTB.},

  abstract = {The economic transition in developing countries is not always the result of the change from a centrally-planned to a free-market economy, but may be found within an already existing free-market economy as a result of profound political change, as in South Africa. The release of Nelson Mandela in February 1990 heralded an end both to the political system of apartheid and to the concomitant social, political, and economic disenfranchisement of 30 million non-White people in South Africa. The first freely elected non-White government came to power in 1994 and initiated a number of social and economic reforms aimed at alleviating the worst consequences of apartheid. This paper examines the effect of post-apartheid economic and social transition on the growth and development of urban children. Over 4000 children born in Soweto and Johannesburg were enrolled in the Birth to Ten (BTT) birth-cohort study in 1990. Whilst these children were born with lower birth weights than in developed countries, they did grow strongly in infancy, particularly in weight, to reflect normal reference values for body mass index (BMI) by 1 year of age. While post-apartheid social and economic changes were expected to take some time to affect child growth and development, the rate of change has been slower than expected. Data from the BTT study demonstrate that the growth of White children continues to be superior to that of their non-White peers and differences that existed at birth and during infancy have not diminished during childhood and early adolescence. Whatever factors are changed at the national or community levels during economic (and social) transition in South Africa appear not yet to have resulted in improved child physical growth.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: This study explores whether nativity differences in health care and sociodemographic factors help to account for nativity differences in low birth weight (LBW) when comparing US-born Black women (USBW) to Black Immigrant women (BIW). METHODS: Bivariate analyses and multinomial nested logit (MNL) models were performed using the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) dataset. RESULTS: Statistically significant nativity differences between USBW and BIW were found across variables of LBW (p\,=\,.009), marital status (p\,{$<$}\,.001), education level (p\,{$<$}\,.001), receiving public assistance (p\,{$<$}\,.001), health care coverage (p\,{$<$}\,.001), age (p\,{$<$}\,.001), and poverty level income (p\,{$<$}\,.001). Results from the MNL models indicated that BIW were 91\% less likely to have a LBW baby (p\,{$<$}\,.001). When accounting for other sociodemographic and health care related variables differing by nativity, although a statistically significant, narrowing gap between BIW and USBW was observed (OR\,=\,.12, p\,{$<$}\,.001), BIW were still less likely to have a LBW baby. CONCLUSIONS: Differences between USBW and BIW across sociodemographic variables and health care related factors related to adverse pregnancy outcomes were observed in this study. Controlling for the factors attenuated nativity differences but did not eliminate the differences on LBW. Future research should continue to explore this relationship.},

There also exists a discrepancy in birth weight, length, head circumference at birth of boys and girls; on the other hand, placental weights were not so strongly biased by the sex of the fetus. Metabolic differences between the sexes are clearly recognized in adults. It is therefore argued that the anthropometric differences at birth, examples of which are presented in this paper, can only be achieved if the products of conception are also expressing a sexual bias in metabolism and physiology. It would then be this bias which would determine the efficiency of the implantation and growth processes and lead to rates of survival to birth. The speculation arising from this and the experimental manipulation of the sex ratio is that the physiological component most likely to be involved would be the lipid compartment with its strong sex difference. {\copyright} 1987 IRL Press Ltd.},

Methods This longitudinal study used Brazilian National Information System for livebirths (SINASC) linked to the gestational syphilis cases from Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN) from 2011 to 2017. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were used to compare the birth outcomes of pregnant women with and without syphilis. The study protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Institute of Collective Health of the Federal University of Bahia (CAAE: registration no. 18022319.4.0000.5030). Results A total of 17 930 817 live births were included in the study. Of these, 155 214 (8.7/1000) were exposed to syphilis during pregnancy. Maternal syphilis increased the odds of low birth weight (aOR 1.88, 95\% CI: 1.85--1.91), small for gestational age (aOR 1.53, 95\% CI: 1.51--1.56), and preterm birth (aOR 1.35, 95\% CI: 1.33--1.37). Higher odds were observed for pregnant women with VDRL titer {$\geq$}64 and untreated maternal syphilis when compared to mothers without syphilis. Analysis stratified by prenatal care showed higher odds for all adverse birth outcomes for mothers attending {$\leq$}6 prenatal appointments. Conclusion Our findings showed a strong association between gestational syphilis and adverse birth outcomes with increased odds observed among women with higher VDRL titers, lack of treatment, and fewer prenatal appointments. These results highlight the need for adequate screening and treatment for gestational syphilis during pregnancy to mitigate the risk of adverse birth outcomes.},

METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using searches in two online databases, PubMed and Literature in the Health Sciences in Latin America and the Caribbean (LILACS). The searches covered materials published between 1 January 1982 and 5 May 2016. The search terms used were ("infant, premature" OR "infant, small for gestational age" OR "fetal growth retardation") AND ("socioeconomic factors" OR "ethnic groups" OR "maternal age"). RESULTS: A total of 3 070 references that met the initial selection criteria were analyzed, and 157 relevant studies were fully read. We located 18 studies that investigated associations of family or maternal income, education, or ethnicity with low birthweight, small-for-gestational-age birth, or preterm birth. Of the 18, 10 of them involved high-income countries, and 8 dealt with middle- or low-income countries. Greater evidence was found for an association between ethnicity and the three outcomes studied, particularly for prematurity among children of black mothers. There was little evidence for an association between maternal/family income or education and any of the three outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Income and education weren't determinants for low birthweight, small-for-gestational-age birth, or preterm birth. However, black ethnicity was strongly associated with the three outcomes, especially with prematurity.},

Yet even many people who claim to abhor racism take for granted that human ``races'' have a biological reality. In Troublesome Science, Rob DeSalle and Ian Tattersall provide a lucid and forceful critique of how scientific tools have been misused to uphold misguided racial categorizations.DeSalle and Tattersall argue that taxonomy, the scientific classification of organisms, provides an antidote to the myth of race's biological basis. They explain how taxonomists do their science---how to identify a species and to understand the relationships among different species and the variants within them. DeSalle and Tattersall also detail the use of genetic data to trace human origins and look at how scientists have attempted to recognize discrete populations within Homo sapiens. Troublesome Science demonstrates conclusively that modern genetic tools, when applied correctly to the study of human variety, fail to find genuine differences. While the diversity that exists within our species is a real phenomenon, it nevertheless defeats any systematic attempt to recognize discrete units within it. The stark lines that humans insist on drawing between their own groups and others are nothing but a mixture of imagination and ideology. Troublesome Science is an important call for researchers, journalists, and citizens to cast aside the belief that race has a biological meaning, for the sake of social justice and sound science alike.},

Using a new variation of the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition technique, I find that racial differences in asset levels and probabilities of having self-employed fathers explain a large part of the gap in the entry rate, but almost none of the gap in the exit rate.},

It examines how we define and measure health and nutrition as well as key issues such as whether increased longevity contributes to greater productivity or, instead, imposes burdens on society through the higher costs of healthcare and pensions.

  abstract = {Trends in human welfare in Brazil have remained shrouded by a dearth of historical evidence. Although quantitative scholars have revealed the efficacy of the First Republic (1889--1930) in fomenting economic progress, the extent to which Brazil's early economic growth fostered improvements in health remains unclear. This paper fills this void in scholarship by relying on hitherto untapped archival sources with data on human stature---a reliable metric for health and nutritional status. My analysis centres heavily on a large (n {$\approx$} 16,000), geographically-comprehensive series compiled from military inscription files, supplemented by an ancillary dataset drawn from passport records (n {$\approx$} 6,000). I document inferior heights in the North and Northeast that predated the advent of industrialisation. At the national level, my findings reveal an increase in stature of over 2.5 cm between soldiers born in the 1880s and those born in the 1910s. In the South and Southeast, I argue that increased real income and public-health interventions explain the earlier upward trend in heights, while rural sanitary reforms were most important in the North and Northeast, where heights remained stagnant until the 1910 decade and diseases such as hookworm and malaria were most rampant., Las tendencias en el bienestar humano en Brasil no han sido estudiadas por una escasez de evidencia hist{\'o}rica. Los estudios cuantitativos muestran la eficacia de la Primera Rep{\'u}blica (1889--1930) para fomentar el progreso econ{\'o}mico, pero no queda claro hasta qu{\'e} punto el crecimiento econ{\'o}mico inicial de Brasil gener{\'o} mejoras en la salud. Este trabajo llena este vac{\'i}o en la literatura al basarse en fuentes primarias hasta ahora no estudiadas, con datos sobre la estatura humana, una m{\'e}trica confiable para la salud y el estado nutricional. Mi an{\'a}lisis se centra en una gran serie (n {$\approx$} 16,000), geogr{\'a}ficamente integral, compilada a partir de archivos de inscripci{\'o}n militares, complementada por un conjunto de datos auxiliares extra{\'i}dos de registros de pasaportes (n {$\approx$} 6,000). Se documentan estaturas inferiores en el norte y el noreste que precedieron el advenimiento de la industrialisaci{\'o}n. Al nivel nacional, mis hallazgos revelan un aumento en la estatura de m{\'a}s de 2,5 cm entre los soldados nacidos en la d{\'e}cada de 1880 y los nacidos en la d{\'e}cada de 1910. En el sur y el sureste, el aumento de ingresos reales y las intervenciones de salud p{\'u}blica explican la tendencia alcista en las estaturas, mientras que las reformas sanitarias rurales fueron m{\'a}s importantes en el norte y el noreste, donde las estaturas permanecieron estancadas hasta la d{\'e}cada de 1910 y las enfermedades como la anquilostomiasis y la malaria eran m{\'a}s generalisadas.},

The mean birth weight was 7.48 pounds for live infants and compares favorably with mid-20th century standards; only 10\% were below the critical level of 2500 grams. The absolute risk of fetal and first-day mortality, holding birth weight constant, is considerably higher than in modern data. There is no evidence of a time trend in birth weight, with the important exception of a sharp drop from 1866 to 1870. A mother's length of stay in the almshouse increased the weight of her infant. The poorhouse, despite much criticism, had some ameliorative impact.}

We assessed the vitamin B12 status in both malnourished and normally nourished pregnant women and their neonates. Additionally, we studied the association between maternal B12 levels, cord B12 levels and neonatal anthropometry. Methods This cross-sectional study enrolled 63 malnourished and 63 normally nourished mothers and neonates. Maternal and cord blood samples were collected at the time of delivery for estimation of vitamin B12 levels. Maternal and cord vitamin B12 levels were compared using the Mann--Whitney U test. Neonatal anthropometry was correlated with maternal and cord B12 levels using Spearman's correlation. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 25. Results Mean maternal age was 26.58 yrs. The median cord B12 levels were lower than the maternal B12 levels. Maternal B12 levels showed a strong positive correlation with cord B12 levels (rho = 0.879; p \&lt; 0.001). Maternal (p \&lt; 0.001) and cord (p \&lt; 0.001) vitamin B12 levels were significantly lower in the malnourished group than in the normally nourished group. In malnourished group, 66.8\% mothers and 95.2\% neonates were Vitamin B12 deficient, whereas 1.5\% mothers and 4.7\% neonates were vitamin B12 deficient in normally nourished group. In the malnourished group, maternal B12 levels were positively correlated with birth weight (rho 0.363, p = 0.003) and length (rho 0.330, p =0.008), whereas cord B12 levels were positively correlated with birth weight in the normally nourished group. (rho 0.277 p= 0.028) Conclusion High rates of vitamin B12 deficiency were observed in malnourished mothers and neonates. There was a positive correlation between birth weight, length, and maternal vitamin B12 levels in malnourished mothers. These findings emphasize the need to address maternal malnutrition and vitamin B12 deficiency to improve neonatal health.},

During that early public health crisis, White physicians and lay people erroneously thought that Black people were immune to yellow fever because of their race. I then highlight the efforts of Philadelphia's Black leaders during the epidemic---namely Absalom Jones and Richard Allen---to challenge the belief in fundamental and innate differences between Blacks and Whites., I conclude by asking us to consider how the false belief that there is something peculiar about Black people's bodies has become a feature, not an aberration, in the production of medical knowledge. Indeed, I point out how medical experimentation in the 20th century and in the marketing of new drugs in the 21st century have been buttressed by this persistent yet incorrect assumption that innate racial differences exist.},

  abstract = {Purpose To research the origins of the 2500~g cutoff for low birth weight and the evolution of indicators to identify newborns at high mortality risk. Description Early research concluded ``prematurity'', measured mainly through birth weight, was responsible for increased health risks. The World Health Organization's original prematurity definition was birth weight {$\leq$}2500~g. 1960s research clarified the difference between gestational age and birth weight leading to questions of the causal role of birth weight for health outcomes. Focus turned to two etiologies of low birth weight, preterm births and intrauterine growth restriction, which were both causally associated with morbidity and mortality but through different pathways; a standard cutoff based on gestational age or customized cutoff was debated. Assessment While low birth weight can be due to preterm or intrauterine growth restriction (or both), the historic 2500~g cutoff remains the standard by which the majority of policy makers define low birth weight and use it to predict perinatal and infant adverse outcomes. Conclusion Current efforts to refocus research on preterm births and poor intrauterine growth are important to understanding the direct causes of mortality rather than low birth weight as a convenient surrogate. Such distinctions also allow researchers and practitioners to test and target interventions outcomes more effectively.},

This debate currently centers on the degree to which "race residuals" are a result of unobserved differences in the social context or unobserved differences in population characteristics. The comparative study of native and foreign-born Black populations represents a quasi-experimental design where race is "held constant". Such studies present a unique opportunity to improve our understanding of the social determinants of population health disparities. Since native and foreign-born Black populations occupy different sociocultural locations, and since populations with greater African ancestry have greater genetic diversity, comparative studies of these populations will advance our understanding of the complex relationship between sociocultural context, population characteristics and health outcomes. Therefore, we offer a conceptual framing for the comparative study of native and foreign-born Blacks along with a review of 208 studies that compare the mental and physical health of these populations. Although there is some complexity, especially with respect to mental health, the overall pattern is that foreign-born Blacks have better health outcomes than native-born Blacks. After reviewing these studies, we conclude with suggestions for future studies in this promising area of social and medical research.},

Maternal factors include a wide array of factors (anthropometric, hematological, or genetic), which can affect newborn health determinants. The objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of normal birth length and its determinants in newborns., Methods, This retrospective cross-sectional study was carried out at the Obstetrics and Gynaecological Department of Hamdard Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan, from March 1,~2019, to August 31,~2019. The relevant data were gathered by trained data collectors with the help of a structured questionnaire designed specifically for the study after taking written informed consent from all the participants. Data analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences Version 20. Binary logistic regression was applied to develop a risk assessment model for the study outcome., Results, Out of 195 pregnant mothers, 57 (29.2\%) had low birth weight infants. Mean age of mothers was 29.29{\textpm}5.22 years, 142 (72.8\%) had BMI of 25.0 or more, 102 (52.3\%) had hemoglobin between 10 to 11 mg/dL, 172 (88.2\%) used to take vitamin C and iron during pregnancy, 136 (69.7\%) consumed extra meals during pregnancy, and only 5 (2.6\%) were tobacco smokers/chewers.

Differences in genetic and socioeconomic factors present between these two groups can explain only part of birth weight variation. I propose a hypothesis that the low birth weight of contemporary African Americans not only results from the difference in present exposure to lifestyle factors known to affect fetal development but also from conditions experienced during the period of slavery. Slaves had poor nutritional status during all stages of life because of the inadequate dietary intake accompanied by high energetic costs of physical work and infectious diseases. The concept of "fetal programming" suggests that physiology and metabolism including growth and fat accumulation of the developing fetus, and, thus its birth weight, depend on intergenerational signal of environmental quality passed through generations of matrilinear ancestors. I suggest that several generations that have passed since the abolition of slavery in the United States (1865) has not been enough to obliterate the impact of slavery on the current biological and health condition of the African-American population.},

We performed genome-wide association studies on birth weight in the genomes of the child and parents and further analyzed birth length and ponderal index, yielding a total of 243 fetal growth variants. We clustered those variants based on the effects of transmitted and nontransmitted alleles on birth weight. Out of 141 clustered variants, 22 were consistent with parent-of-origin-specific effects. We further used haplotype-specific polygenic risk scores to directly test the relationship between adult traits and birth weight. Our results indicate that the maternal genome contributes to increased birth weight through blood-glucose-raising alleles while blood-pressure-raising alleles reduce birth weight largely through the fetal genome.},

Thiamine is an important cofactor in various metabolic pathways and thus its deficiency could have a serious impact on both maternal and fetal outcomes. Kashmir has thiamine deficiency in endemic proportions, with multiple reports of infantile beriberi, postpartum neuropathy, and gastric beriberi. This prompted us to assess the extent of the burden of thiamine deficiency during pregnancy. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted for a period of two years in pregnant women attending the antenatal clinic. A demographic, clinical, biochemical, and dietary assessment was done in all participants. The whole blood thiamine levels were assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Results A total of 492 participants were included in the study with a mean age of 30.30{\textpm}4.57 years and a mean BMI of 24.25{\textpm}3.32 Kg/m2. The mean whole blood thiamine level of all participants was 133.29{\textpm}14.32 nmol/L. Low thiamine status was present in 38.2\% (n = 188) of participants. Participants with low thiamine had poor perinatal outcomes, with 3.1\% (n = 6) reporting early infant death. Conclusion A high prevalence of thiamine deficiency occurs in pregnant women of Kashmir. Low thiamine is associated with poor nutritional status as well as poor perinatal outcomes. Trial registration CTRI/2022/07/044217.},

Para verificar a associa{\c c}{\~a}o entre peso ao nascer e caracter{\'i}sticas maternas, sociodemogr{\'a}ficas, biol{\'o}gicas e da assist{\^e}ncia pr{\'e}-natal ({\'i}ndice de Kotelchuck modificado), realizaram-se regress{\~o}es lineares m{\'u}ltiplas, estratificando as pu{\'e}rperas segundo n{\'i}vel de instru{\c c}{\~a}o. Foi utilizada a t{\'e}cnica de bootstrap com intervalos de confian{\c c}a acurados para as estimativas dos efeitos. RESULTADOS: Na an{\'a}lise bivariada, para quase todas as vari{\'a}veis estudadas, as m{\'e}dias de peso ao nascer foram menores entre as m{\~a}es de escolaridade mais baixa. Na an{\'a}lise da regress{\~a}o m{\'u}ltipla para o grupo de baixa escolaridade, o peso ao nascer associou-se diretamente com o {\'i}ndice de Kotelchuck modificado e a idade gestacional, e inversamente com as vari{\'a}veis cor da pele preta, h{\'a}bito de fumar e a experi{\^e}ncia de filhos prematuros anteriores. Idade materna e paridade tiveram comportamentos distintos nos extremos e na faixa central dos dados. No grupo de maior escolaridade somente a paridade, a idade gestacional e o {\'i}ndice de Kotelchuck modificado foram significativos e se associaram diretamente com o peso ao nascer. Verificou-se o papel protetor da assist{\^e}ncia pr{\'e}-natal, assim como o efeito negativo do h{\'a}bito de fumar independente do n{\'i}vel de escolaridade das m{\~a}es. CONCLUS{\~O}ES: As vari{\'a}veis que explicaram o peso ao nascer dos neonatos de m{\~a}es com elevada escolaridade foram de natureza biol{\'o}gica, em contraste com os determinantes sociais encontrados no grupo de baixa escolaridade.},

Racial disparities in pregnancy outcomes are reported in many countries, but an especially marked contrast is evident in the United States. Because of the size of the problem, considerable research has investigated the involvement of genetic and social factors. However, race is a social construct and evidence suggests that in the United States the effect of Black race on PTB is environmental, not genetic. This derives since stress accumulates throughout a lifetime and across generations leading to a large accumulated allostatic load that is mediated by epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic mechanisms can however be reversed and therein lies future hope.},

  abstract = {During the last months of the Second World War the Western Netherlands was affected by an acute famine, known as the Hunger Winter. Food intake from all sources was reduced to extremely low levels. The effect on mortality at all ages was very large and immediate. By making use of unpublished data from the Dutch Central Bureau of Statistics, estimates could be made of the changes in mortality by cause of death and age for both sexes. Mortality due to hunger was most common in the very young and the very old whereas the effects in males were more pronounced than in females. Hunger was a contributing factor to the increased mortality due to infectious diseases and diseases of the digestive system.In several follow-up studies on selected populations, long-term consequences of the famine could be studied. They related to reproductive outcomes of women who gave birth during the Hunger Winter, to birth weight, malformations, and perinatal mortality of the newborn who were exposed to the famine during gestation, and to the long-term effects of the famine on the medical and psychological situation of infants born during the famine. Several studies on reproductive outcomes in the subsequent generation are also discussed.},

Infants with a black mother and father have the lowest mean birthweights, while infants with two white parents have the highest weights.

We find protective effects of additional birthweight against infant mortality and health capital loss, such as cerebral palsy, but in contrast to sibling and twin studies, no strong evidence for non-health long-run outcomes, such as test scores.

We analyzed trends in mortality among infants born to White and to Black or mixed-race women in 3 population-based cohorts representing all births in 1982, 1993, and 2004 in Pelotas, southern Brazil. Methods. Births were assessed during daily visits to all maternity hospitals. Maternal skin color was classified by the interviewers as White or Black or multi-racial. We used logistic regression to adjust for socioeconomic, demographic, and health services variables. Results. The mortality rate among infants born to White mothers declined from 30.4 per 1000 live births in 1982 to 13.9 per 1000 in 2004, compared with 53.8 per 1000 to 30.4 per 1000 among those born to Black and mixed-race mothers. Differences for neonatal mortality were even more marked, with reductions of 47\% and 11\% for infants born to White and Black or mixed-race women, respectively. Adjusted analyses showed that ethnic group differences in neonatal and infant mortality were partly explained by differences in poverty and prenatal care. Conclusions. Over a 22-year period, improvements in health indicators were greater for infants born to White women than for other infants. The widening racial gap requires special attention from policymakers.},

STUDY DESIGN: The study comprised all singleton live births to Black women in California between 2011 and 2017. We defined maternal nativity as US-born or foreign-born. Using Poisson regression, we computed risk ratios (RR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for three adverse perinatal outcomes: preterm birth, small for gestational age deliveries, and infant mortality. RESULTS: Rates of adverse perinatal outcomes were significantly higher among US-born Black women. In adjusted models, US-born Black women experienced an increased risk of preterm birth (RR 1.51, 95\% CI 1.39, 1.65) and small for gestational age deliveries (RR 1.52, 95\% CI 1.41, 1.64), compared to foreign-born Black women.

Here, we first survey the historical prominence of models of environmental determinism in early formulations of racial thinking to illustrate how notions of direct environmental effects on bodies have been used to naturalize racial hierarchy and inequalities in the past. Next, we conduct a scoping review of postgenomic work in environmental epigenetics and DOHaD that looks at the role of race/ethnicity in human health (2000--2021). Although there is substantial heterogeneity in how race is conceptualized and interpreted across studies, we observe practices that may unwittingly encourage typological thinking, including: using DNA methylation as a novel marker of racial classification; neglect of variation and reversibility within supposedly homogenous racial groups; and a tendency to label and reify whole groups as pathologized or impaired. Even in the very different politico-economic and epistemic context of contemporary postgenomic science, these trends echo deeply held beliefs in Western thinking which claimed that different environments shape different bodies and then used this logic to argue for essential differences between Europeans and non-Europeans. We conclude with a series of suggestions on interpreting and reporting findings in these fields that we feel will help researchers harness this work to benefit disadvantaged groups while avoiding the inadvertent dissemination of new and old forms of stigma or prejudice.},

  abstract = {In the United States (US), epidemiologists have long documented paradoxically lower rates of adverse perinatal health outcomes among immigrant birthing people than what might be expected in light of socioeconomic and language barriers to healthcare, especially as compared to their US-born racial and ethnic counterparts. However, researchers have also documented significant variability in this immigrant birth paradox when examining within and across racial and ethnic subgroups. This review paper summarizes fifty years of research regarding differences in low, preterm birth, and infant mortality in the US, according to the nativity status of the birthing person. While there is ample evidence of the importance of nativity in delineating a pregnant person's risk of adverse infant outcomes, this review also highlights the relative paucity of research exploring the intersection of acculturation, ethnic enclaves, and structural segregation. We also provide recommendations for advancing the study of perinatal outcomes among immigrants.},

In this paper, we review the findings from a cohort of 2414 people, aged 50 years, born as term singletons around the time of the 1944--1945 Dutch famine, of which 912 people participated in an interview and 741 subjects were also available for hospital examination. We found more coronary heart disease, raised lipids, altered clotting and more obesity after exposure to famine in early gestation compared to those not exposed to the famine. Exposure in mid gestation was associated with obstructive airways disease and microalbuminuria. We found decreased glucose tolerance in people exposed to famine in late gestation. These findings show that maternal undernutrition during gestation has important effects on health in later life, but that the timing of the nutritional insult determines which organ system is affected. Future research should shed more light upon the underlying pathophysiology of the far-reaching effects of prenatal exposure to famine.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding current levels, as well as past and future trends, of the percentage of infants born at low birthweight (LBW) in the United States is imperative to improving the health of our nation. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to examine recent trends in percentage of LBW, both overall and by maternal race and education subgroups. Studying disparities in percentage of LBW by these subgroups can help to further understand the health needs of the population and can inform policies that can close race and class disparities in poor birth outcomes. METHODS: Trends of percentage of LBW in the U.S. from 2003 to 2018, both overall and by race/ethnicity, and from 2007 to 2018 by education and race by education subgroups were analyzed using CDC WONDER Natality data. Disparities were analyzed using between group variance methods. RESULTS: Percentage of LBW experienced a significant worsening in the most recent 5\,years of data, negating nearly a decade of prior improvement. Stark differences were observed by race/ethnicity and by education, with all subgroups experiencing increasing rates in recent years. Disparities also worsened over the course of study. Most notably, all disparities increased significantly from 2014 to 2018, with annual changes near 2-5\%. CONCLUSIONS: Recent reversals in progress in percentage of LBW, as well as increasing disparities particularly by race, are troubling. Future study is needed to continue monitoring these trends and analyzing these issues at additional levels. Targets must be set and solutions must be tailored to population subgroups to effectively make progress towards equitable birth outcomes and maternal health.},

Using a dataset of 1523 birth records that include birth weight and length we find 852 (58\%) of the adult cohort in World War II records measuring stature, body mass and blood pressure. On average, the boys weighed 3.5~kg at birth, similar to Australian and American babies of the era, and nearly identical to full-term New Zealand babies in the 1990s. Using OLS regression models we estimate the effect of birth weight on adult stature and systolic blood pressure. We find an increase in birth weight of 1~kg is associated with an increase in stature of 2.6~cm (95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.6~cm--3.6~cm), and a decrease in systolic blood pressure of 2.1~mm/Hg (95\% CI -- 5.00 to 0.67). This is the earliest cohort by fifty years for whom the fetal origins hypothesis has been examined in early adulthood. Our estimates of the effect of birth weight on blood pressure are towards the upper end of the range of published estimates in modern cohorts.},

Poor maternal nutrition during gestation may contribute to restricted fetal growth, leading to increased disease susceptibility in later life. Animal studies have shown that undernutrition during gestation is associated with reduced life span and increased disease susceptibility. The Dutch famine is a unique counterpart for animal models that study the effects of restricted maternal nutrition during different stages of gestation. This paper describes the findings from a cohort study of 2414 people born around the time of the Dutch famine. Exposure to famine during any stage of gestation was associated with glucose intolerance. We found more coronary heart disease, a more atherogenic lipid profile, disturbed blood coagulation, increased stress responsiveness and more obesity among those exposed to famine in early gestation. Women exposed to famine in early gestation also had an increased risk of breast cancer. People exposed to famine in mid gestation had more microalbuminuria and obstructive airways disease. These findings show that maternal undernutrition during gestation has important effects on health in later life, but that the effects on health depend on its timing during gestation. Especially early gestation seems to be a vulnerable period. Adequate dietary advice to women before and during pregnancy seems a promising strategy in preventing chronic diseases in future generations.},

In the second half of the twentieth century, cesarean sections proliferated in clinical practice, but abortions remained illegal. Most importantly, women remained patients to be worked on rather than active participants in their reproductive lives.},

However, there are few studies with moderation analysis on maternal dietary patterns and infant birth weight. We aim to analyse the association between dietary patterns during pregnancy and birth weight. A prospective cohort study was performed with pregnant women registered with the prenatal service (Bahia, Brazil). A food frequency questionnaire was used to evaluate dietary intake. Birth weight was measured by a prenatal service team. Statistical analyses were performed using factor analysis with a principal component extraction technique and structural equation modelling. The mean age of the pregnant women was 27 years old (SD: 5.5) and the mean birth weight was 3341.18 g. It was observed that alcohol consumption (p = 0.05) and weight-gain during pregnancy (p = 0.05) were associated with birth weight. Four patterns of dietary consumption were identified for each trimester of the pregnancy evaluated. Adherence to the ``Meat, Eggs, Fried Snacks and Processed foods'' dietary pattern (pattern 1) and the ``Sugars and Sweets'' dietary pattern (pattern 4) in the third trimester directly reduced birth weight, by 98.42 g (Confidence interval (CI) 95\%: 24.26, 172.59) and 92.03 g (CI 95\%: 39.88, 165.30), respectively. It was also observed that insufficient dietary consumption in the third trimester increases maternal complications during pregnancy, indirectly reducing birth weight by 145 g (CI 95\%: -21.39, -211.45). Inadequate dietary intake in the third trimester appears to have negative results on birth weight, directly and indirectly, but more studies are needed to clarify these causal paths, especially investigations of the influence of the maternal dietary pattern on the infant gut microbiota and the impacts on perinatal outcomes.},

  abstract = {The incidence and some determinants of low birth weight (LBW) were studied in two population-based cohorts of singletons born live to families in Ribeir{\~a}o Preto, S{\~a}o Paulo State, Brazil. The first cohort comprised infants born between June 1978 and May 1979 (6750 births--population survey) and the second, infants born between May and August 1994 (2990 births--sample survey). The incidence of LBW was 7.2\% in 1978-79 and 10.6\% in 1994. After adjustment for confounding factors, the following determinants remained significant in 1978-79: female sex, maternal age {$>$} or = 35 years, preterm delivery, {$<$} four antenatal health visits, maternal smoking, lower level of maternal education, and manual work/unemployment. In 1994, the significant determinants were preterm delivery, maternal smoking and caesarean section. The adjusted percentage population attributable risk (PAR\%) fell for the majority of risk factors but increased for caesarean section, preterm birth, multiparity ({$>$} or = 5), primiparity and non-cohabitation. The increase in the rate of LBW from 1978-79 to 1994 was higher for families with more qualified occupations, and occurred only for infants delivered at 36-40 weeks' gestational age and weighing 1500-2499 g, i.e. those most likely to be born by elective caesarean section. The caesarean section rate rose from 30.3\% in 1978-79 to 51.1\% in 1994. The increase in LBW was probably due to iatrogenic practices associated with elective caesarean section.},

  abstract = {Despite positive changes in most maternal risk factors in Brazil, previous studies did not show reductions in preterm birth and low birthweight. We analysed trends and inequalities in these outcomes over a 33-year period in a Brazilian city.Four population-based birth cohort studies were carried out in the city of Pelotas in 1982, 1993, 2004 and 2015, with samples ranging from 4231 to 5914 liveborn children. Low birthweight (LBW) was defined as\,\&lt;2500\,g, and preterm birth as less than 37\,weeks of gestation. Information was collected on family income, maternal skin colour and other risk factors for low birthweight. Multivariable linear regression was used to estimate the contribution of risk factors to time trends in birthweight.Preterm births increased from 5.8\% (1982) to 13.8\% (2015), and LBW prevalence increased from 9.0\% to 10.1\%, being higher for boys and for children born to mothers with low income and brown or black skin colour. Mean birthweight remained stable, around 3200\,g, but increased from 3058 to 3146\,g in the poorest quintile and decreased from 3307 to 3227\,g in the richest quintile. After adjustment for risk factors for LBW, mean birthweight was estimated to have declined by 160\,g over 1982--2015 (reductions of 103\,g in the poorest and 213\,g in the richest quintiles).Data from four birth cohorts show that preterm births increased markedly. Mean birthweights remained stable over a 33-year period. Increased prevalence of preterm and early term births, associated with high levels of obstetric interventions, has offset the expected improvements due to reduction in risk factors for low birthweight.},

  abstract = {The timing of parturition is crucial for neonatal survival and infant health. Yet, its genetic basis remains largely unresolved. We present a maternal genome-wide meta-analysis of gestational duration (n\,=\,195,555), identifying 22 associated loci (24 independent variants) and an enrichment in genes differentially expressed during labor. A meta-analysis of preterm delivery (18,797 cases, 260,246 controls) revealed seven associated loci and large genetic similarities with gestational duration. Analysis of the parental transmitted and nontransmitted alleles (n\,=\,136,833) shows that 15 of the gestational duration genetic variants act through the maternal genome, whereas 7 act both through the maternal and fetal genomes and 2 act only via the fetal genome. Finally, the maternal effects on gestational duration show signs of antagonistic pleiotropy with the fetal effects on birth weight: maternal alleles that increase gestational duration have negative fetal effects on birth weight. The present study provides insights into the genetic effects on the timing of parturition and the complex maternal--fetal relationship between gestational duration and birth weight.},

  abstract = {Risk-stratification screening for SGA has been proposed in high-income countries to prevent perinatal morbidity and mortality. There is paucity of data from middle-income settings. The aim of this study is to explore risk factors for SGA in Brazil and assess potential for risk stratification. This population-based study is a secondary analysis of Birth in Brazil study, conducted in 266 maternity units between 2011 and 2012. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were performed, and population attributable fraction estimated for early and all pregnancy factors. We calculated absolute risk, odds ratio, and population prevalence of single or combined factors stratified by parity. Factors associated with SGA were maternal lupus (ORadj 4.36, 95\% CI [2.32--8.18]), hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (ORadj 2.72, 95\% CI [2.28--3.24]), weight gain\,{$<$}\,5~kg (ORadj 2.37, 95\% CI [1.99--2.83]), smoking at late pregnancy (ORadj 2.04, 95\% CI [1.60--2.59]), previous low birthweight (ORadj 2.22, 95\% CI [1.79--2.75]), nulliparity (ORadj 1.81, 95\% CI [1.60--2.05]), underweight (ORadj 1.61, 95\% CI [1.36--1.92]) and socioeconomic status (SES)\,{$<$}\,5th centile (ORadj 1.23, 95\% CI [1.05--1.45]). Having two or more risk factors (prevalence of 4.4\% and 8.0\%) was associated with a 2 and fourfold increase in the risk for SGA in nulliparous and multiparous, respectively. Early and all pregnancy risk factors allow development of risk-stratification for SGA. Implementation of risk stratification coupled with specific strategies for reduction of risk and increased surveillance has the potential to contribute to the reduction of stillbirth in Brazil through increased detection of SGA, appropriate management and timely delivery.},

This paper argues that the living standards of slave children were exceedingly poor; newborns weighed on average less than 5.5 pounds and the infant mortality rate was at least 30--35\%. These results contrast sharply with general perceptions of slave health. Diet, disease and work during pregnancy, postnatal practices, and possibly genetic factors contributed to poor health. The findings have implications for estimates of slave fertility and for estimating the underenumeration of vital events and infant mortality in other populations.},

Regression-based analyses were performed to examine the individual and joint effects of genetic ancestry and stress (including lifetime stress [LS] and stress during pregnancy [PS]) on PTB and related traits among U.S. born and immigrant mothers.Significant associations between LS and PTB and related traits were found in the total study population and in immigrant mothers, including gestational age, birthweight, PTB, and spontaneous PTB; but no association was found in U.S. born mothers. Furthermore, significant joint associations of LS (or PS) and African ancestral proportion (AAP) on PTB were found in immigrant mothers, but not in U.S. born mothers.Although, overall, immigrant women had lower rates of PTB compared to U.S. born women, our study is one of the first to identify a subset of immigrant women could be at significantly increased risk of PTB and related outcomes if they have high AAP and are under high LS or PS. In light of the growing number of immigrant mothers in the U.S., our findings may have important clinical and public health implications.},

This study evaluated the relationship of birth weight with Infant mortality (IM) through the influence of biological, social, and health care factors in a time series. Methods Retrospective cohort study with data collected from Information Systems (Live Births and Mortality). The mortality trends were performed for each birth weight stratum: extremely low, {$<$} 1000\,g; very low, 1000--1499\,g; low, 1500--2499\,g; insufficient, 2500--2999\,g; adequate, 3000--3900\,g; and macrosomia, {$>$} 4000\,g. Chi-square tests analyzed IM rates. Sequential Poisson regression analyzed the impact of the determinant factors. Results A total of 277,982 newborns were included in the study and 2088 died before their first year. There was a tendency for a decrease in mortality in all strata of weight. With the exception of macrosomics, all other strata had a higher risk for IM when compared with adequate birth weight. Extremely LBW newborns presented higher risk for mortality when born in a public hospital. A higher percentage of infant deaths were associated with lower maternal age and lower schooling for all strata. Prenatal care with less than three visits demonstrated a risk for IM in low, insufficient, and adequate birth weight strata. The cesarean section was a protective factor for IM in Extremely and Very LBW strata and it was a risk factor in adequate birth weight stratum. Conclusions LBW had a greater association with IM, especially those children of younger mothers and those born in public hospitals.},

In this study of newborn weight and economic growth in Boston, Dublin, Edinburgh, Montreal, and Vienna between 1850 and 1930, W. Peter Ward explores the relation between infant size, economic development, and living standards of working-class women in the industrializing West.Drawing on clinical records from urban maternity hospitals and outpatient services, Ward compares birth weight between cities and traces changes in fetal size during a period in which some cities experienced dramatic economic development while others stagnated. Because fetal growth is strongly affected by maternal nutrition, Ward's research sheds new light on the well-being of working-class women whose living conditions have long been obscure and exceedingly difficult to examine.This book will interest social and economic historians, as well as scholars of women's studies and the history of medicine, and its lessons on the distribution of social benefits during economic change have immidiate relevance for today's developing countries.},

  abstract = {Birth weight variation is influenced by fetal and maternal genetic and non-genetic factors, and has been reproducibly associated with future cardio-metabolic health outcomes. In expanded genome-wide association analyses of own birth weight (n\,=\,321,223) and offspring birth weight (n\,=\,230,069 mothers), we identified 190 independent association signals (129 of which are novel). We used structural equation modeling to decompose the contributions of direct fetal and indirect maternal genetic effects, then applied Mendelian randomization to illuminate causal pathways. For example, both indirect maternal and direct fetal genetic effects drive the observational relationship between lower birth weight and higher later blood pressure: maternal blood pressure-raising alleles reduce offspring birth weight, but only direct fetal effects of these alleles, once inherited, increase later offspring blood pressure. Using maternal birth weight-lowering genotypes to proxy for an adverse intrauterine environment provided no evidence that it causally raises offspring blood pressure, indicating that the inverse birth weight--blood pressure association is attributable to genetic effects, and not to intrauterine programming.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We examine disparities in birth weight and gestational age by ethnic ancestry in 2000-2011 in eight South American countries. METHODS: The sample included 60,480 singleton live births. Regression models were estimated to evaluate differences in birth outcomes by ethnic ancestry controlling for time trends. RESULTS: Significant disparities were found in seven countries. In four countries-Brazil, Ecuador, Uruguay, and Venezuela-we found significant disparities in both low birth weight and preterm birth. Disparities in preterm birth alone were observed in Argentina, Bolivia, and Colombia. Several differences in continuous birth weight, gestational age, and fetal growth rate were also observed. There were no systematic patterns of disparities between the evaluated ethnic ancestry groups across the study countries, in that no racial/ethnic group consistently had the best or worst outcomes in all countries. CONCLUSIONS: Racial/ethnic disparities in infant health are common in several South American countries. Differences across countries suggest that racial/ethnic disparities are driven by social and economic mechanisms. Researchers and policymakers should acknowledge these disparities and develop research and policy programs to effectively target them.},

  abstract = {Objective We investigate gradients (i.e. differences) in infant health outcomes by maternal education in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Venezuela and explore channels related to father's education, household labor outcomes, and maternal health, fertility, and use of prenatal services and technology. Methods We employ secondary interview and birth record data similarly collected across a network of birth hospitals from the early 1980s through 2011 within the Latin American Collaborative Study of Congenital Anomalies (ECLAMC). Focusing on children without birth defects, we estimate gradients in several infant health outcomes including birth weight, gestational age, and hospital discharge status by maternal education using ordinary least squares regression models adjusting for several demographic factors. To explore channels, we add as covariates father's education, parental occupational activity, maternal health and fertility history, and use of prenatal services and technology and evaluate changes in the coefficient of maternal education. We use the same models for each country sample. Results We find important differences in gradients across countries. We find evidence for educational gradients in preterm birth in three countries but weaker evidence for gradients in fetal growth. The extent to which observed household and maternal factors explain these gradients based on changes in the regression coefficient of maternal education when controlling for these factors as covariates also varies between countries. In contrast, we generally find evidence across all countries that higher maternal education is associated with increased use of prenatal care services and technology. Conclusions Our findings suggest that differences in infant health by maternal education and their underlying mechanisms vary and are not necessarily generalizable across countries. However, the positive association between maternal education and use of prenatal services and technology is more consistent across examined countries.},

  abstract = {Birthweight is one of the most accessible and most misunderstood variables in epidemiology. A baby's weight at birth is strongly associated with mortality risk during the first year and, to a lesser degree, with developmental problems in childhood and the risk of various diseases in adulthood. Epidemiological analyses often regard birthweight as on the causal pathway to these health outcomes. Under this assumption of causality, birthweight is used to explain variations in infant mortality and later morbidity, and is also used as an intermediate health endpoint in itself. Evidence presented here suggests the link between birthweight and health outcomes may not be causal. Methods of analysis that assume causality are unreliable at best, and biased at worst. The category of 'low birthweight' in particular is uninformative and seldom justified. The main utility of the birthweight distribution is to provide an estimate of the proportion of small preterm births in a population (although even this requires special analytical methods). While the ordinary approaches to birthweight are not well grounded, the links between birthweight and a range of health outcomes may nonetheless reflect the workings of biological mechanisms with implications for human health.},
