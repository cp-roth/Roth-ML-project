This folder contains code for simple exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the processed/cleaned data. The code produces a few tables and figures, which are saved in the appropriate `results` sub-folder. All final files will have a _final in the name. Extra code written for creating summary tables is included in a supplemental `.R` script, `edacode-extra.R`, which is in the `rcode_notupdated` folder. This code should not be run, but was relevant to my learning process.

* There is a Quarto file which contains all code, `eda-v1.qmd`.
